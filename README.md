# Python-Experiments
This repository contains the initial code I created when I learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## Plans
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with this file.
